  For this project I am doubling up on a project for my Supply Chain
  Analytics course. It uses Boston housing data which is a fairly common
  dataset that is often used as a sample case. For the class project our
  task was to utilize multiple models and methods that we have learned
  this semester to analyze the data. My portion was regression trees and
  random forests, so that will be all I include here.

Typing some sample text here. Now I want to insert a Tableau image. Let's see if it works!
