  For this project I will double up on a project for my Supply Chain
  Analytics course. We haven't settled on a topic yet, but it is 
  supposed to be a group project where we find a dataset and perform
  some of the analyses on it we've gone over in class: regression, 
  classification, predictive models, etc. I plan to take the work we
  do in that class and convert it for the use of the r-markdown paper
  in PS811.

Typing some sample text here. Now I want to insert a Tableau image. Let's see if it works!
