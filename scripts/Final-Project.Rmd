  For this project I am doubling up on a project for my Supply Chain
  Analytics course. It uses Boston housing data which is a fairly common
  dataset that is often used as a sample case [@housing]. For the class
  project our task was to utilize multiple models and methods that we
  have learned this semester to analyze the data. My portion was
  regression trees and random forests, so that will be all I include
  here.
